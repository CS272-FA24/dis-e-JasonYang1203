Sorting a Pile of Books in Alphabetical Order (Divide and Conquer)

1. Divide the pile of books into smaller groups (around 4-5 books each). Keep the groups manageable for easy sorting.

2. For each small group: Sort that group manually (this is much easier with fewer books).

3. Once all groups are sorted, merge two groups at a time:
    -Compare the first book in each of the two groups.
    -Move the book that comes first alphabetically into a new, larger pile.
    -Repeat the process until both groups are merged into one sorted pile.
    -Continue merging pairs of sorted piles until you have one fully sorted pile of books.

4. End: Now the pile is sorted alphabetically.
